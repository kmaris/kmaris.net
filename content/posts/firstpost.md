We'll see how long I keep this up, but it is something I've needed to do for
a while now. The majority of these posts will probably refer to my
software/tech side of life. But for now I'll just get it all started off with a
fact about tea:

  There is a special name for when tea leaves uncurl as hot water is poured
  over them. It is called “the agony of the leaves.”

You'll only bear witness to the process when not using bagged teas. I highly
recommend giving it a try (or c'mon over to my place) and you can witness it
yourself.
