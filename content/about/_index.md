Kevin Maris, a sneaky-nice guy according to those who know me. Find me running
and hiking barefoot in Boulder, CO. Drinking tea in the morning (but only after
[Good Sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life)).

Day job DevOps / Software build guy but if time and finances accrue owning a
tea shop selling my wife's vegan coffee cake would be great. Not limited to
one aspect; be it software, climbing, reading, running, tea, etc.

And trying to [take things slowly and be deliberate](https://gregmckeown.com/book/).
